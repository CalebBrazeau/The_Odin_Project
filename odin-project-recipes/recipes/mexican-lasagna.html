    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My whole family loves this beefy lasagna flavored with taco seasoning. Even my picky five-year-old will eat it. Serve with shredded lettuce, fresh sliced tomatoes, olives and sour cream.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pound Lean Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 Ounce) Package Taco Seasoning Mix</li>
        <li>1 (14 Ounce) Can Peeled and Diced Tomatoes with Juice</li>
        <li>10 (6 Inch) Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li>1 Cup Prepared Salsa</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Shredded Colby Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef, and stir in the taco seasoning and tomatoes. Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with half the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, then top with the remaining tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
